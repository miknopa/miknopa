- 👋  Hi, I’m Mikko Nopanen alias @miknopa from Finland.
- 👀  I’m interested in software based projects to ease common daily tasks and to reduce boring rutines. 
- 🌱  I’m currently learning almost everything on information technology field trying to collect as much knowledge as possible to make my dream of career change true.
- 💞️   I’m looking to collaborate with people loving their doing and being proud of the results, giving nothing less than everything needed to reach the goal. 
        It makes no harm if you still laugh sometimes. :D
- 📫  How to reach me ... maybe with smoke signal (or try my LinkedIn profile with same alias)
